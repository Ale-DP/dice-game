Live project is available here https://ale-dp.github.io/dice-game/

In this project you can enjoy a classic dice game, with 2 players where you have a button to roll the dice and try to beat robot player with an higher number.
Equal numbers do not assign any point, so you keep rolling until you score 3.
Once one of the 2 player win the match reaching 3 point, an alert appears with a button to roll again and restart the game.

# Features

- Due to the simplicity of the game and the single page I used a unique and nice general Permanent Marker font .

# Media

- Icons are taken from https://fontawesome.com/
- Dices images are taken from https://www.shutterstock.com/
